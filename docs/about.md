## This is me

After facing a dilemma about whether to study Physics (which I thought of as my "estranged first love" at the time) or Computer Science, the latter finally came out on top. CS seemed to have way more room for innovation, and I wanted to innovate. Turns out it was a good decision, because my choice ended up becoming my "second love," so to speak.

I admit I am a novice in my field, but I know for a fact that that status isn't here to stay. During my master thesis, I learned first hand how insightful seemingly chaotic data can be, given proper munging and the right algorithms. I have been hooked on to all things Data Science ever since. In my free time, you will find me listening to podcasts (mainly to learn by listening), coding (mainly to learn by doing) or reading books (<s>mainly to learn by reading</s> mainly fiction to entertain myself).

Someday, my dear reader, you will read my name, maybe even see my face, on the cover of Chip, Wired, or Popular Science. Till then, this humble website will have to suffice.


## The MN in Sanika MN Joshi

For those of you wondering: I don't have a double middle name. My first and last name are far too common, so I included both my parents' initials in my username and it kind of just stuck. 


## Contact

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLtHQcCCOc4Y0NgM2hN5xQ2FNU8ku24r/view?usp=sharing) is my resume. You can reach me on the email address listed in it or through [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanikamnjoshi/). I don't use other social media on principle (unless [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/sanikamnjoshi) counts), so if you find me anywhere else, it probably isn't me.
